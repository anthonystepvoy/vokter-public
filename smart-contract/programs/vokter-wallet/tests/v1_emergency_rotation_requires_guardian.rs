    // Test VOK-SEC-004: V1 emergency rotation should require both owner and guardian signatures
    
    // Setup: Create V1 wallet with specific owner and guardian
    // This test would have failed before the fix - owner-only calls succeeded
    
    // Test 1: Attempt owner-only emergency rotation -> expect failure
    // Expected: Should fail with GuardianNotSigner error due to missing guardian signature
    
    // Test 2: Attempt with owner + guardian signatures -> expect success
    // Expected: Should succeed with proper 2-of-2 multisig validation
    
    // Assertions:
    // - Owner-only calls are rejected
    // - Owner+guardian calls succeed
    // - Guardian binding is properly enforced via has_one constraint
